# ESP32_ILI9341_DHT11

This program uses the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, whos values are displayed 
 on A ILI9341 TFT screen, via the ESP32. The analogue meter(Humidity) was originally designed by Bodmer,
 I believe, and can be found in the TFT_eSPI example folder. I have re-codeed the meter using
 the Arduino_GFX_Library, and the Temperature meter was designed by me, and also uses the 
 Arduino_GFX_Library.
